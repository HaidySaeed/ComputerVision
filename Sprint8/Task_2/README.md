1- What ’re the methods that you used ?

1_resizing image
2_warpAffine
3_canny
4_Gaussian Blurring
5_Median Blur
6_Bilateral Blur

2- Explain each method ..

cv2.INTER_AREA: This is used when we need to shrink an image.
cv2.INTER_CUBIC: This is slow but more efficient.
cv2.INTER_LINEAR: This is primarily used when zooming is required. This is the default interpolation technique in OpenCV.

2_used for rotating an image or used for shifting 

3_used to detect edges

4_used to bluring the images
