1- The methods used:

a-Detect corner of an image using OpenCV
b-Canny edge detection method
c-Corner detection with Harris Corner Detection method
d-Corner Detection with Shi-Tomasi Corner Detection Method

2- Explain each method ..

a-Detect corner of an image using OpenCV:finds N strongest corners in the image by Shi-Tomasi method, Specify the number of corners you want to find and the quality level.
b-Canny edge detection method:is used to detect a wide range of edges in images. OpenCV has in-built function cv2.Canny() which takes our input image as first argument and its aperture size as last two arguments
c-Corner detection with Harris Corner Detection method:was developed to identify the internal corners of an image,is used to extract the corners from the input image and to extract features from the input image.
d-Corner Detection with Shi-Tomasi Corner Detection Method:Here the basic intuition is that corners can be detected by looking for significant change in all direction,We consider a small window on the image then scan the whole image, looking for corners
