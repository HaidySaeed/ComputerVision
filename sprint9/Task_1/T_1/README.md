1- What ’re the methods that you used ?

edge detection methods
sobel,lablacian,canny
hough line transform

2- Explain each method ..

sobel_x:detect verticle edges
sobel_y:detect horizontal edges
we can combine between them to detect all edges by using bitwise_or
lablacian : it detects edges also but for all image and it shows mor detalis
of edges , second drev of image of x and y 
canny : is used to detect a wide range of edges in images 
hough line transform: is used for line detection
